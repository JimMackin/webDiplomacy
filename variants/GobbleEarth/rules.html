<p>Based on the standard map of Diplomacy, Gobble-Earth adds the rest of the world to the fight for hegemony. According to the borders of 1914 and the map drawing principles of standard this variant has seven more powers starting out the competition at a local basis against the colonial empires of Europe.</p>

<p><b>Extra rules:</b></p>

<p>The victory condition is 37 SC.</p>

<p>Like Kiel in standard, Panama and Cairo also have canals.</p>

<p>Home centers are only the centers in a country's core area, other starting possessions are considered neutral for building purposes. On this map the home centers are marked as squares and the neutrals as circles. Home centers belong to one power so it is not possible to do normal builds in someone else's home center.</p>

<p>To raise units far from home any nation can do a colonial build instead of a usual one. A colonial build is like normal build except it has a one year lag. Colonial builds can be ordered by any power in any center. For a colonial build to succeed the building power must have building capacity for that build, as well as having waived (refrained for building when able) one building capacity the winter one and no one than one year prior for each colonial build. Waives from a colonial build is ordered with the syntax of a usual build.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: The software will not forbid you to order more colonial builds than you have capacity for. Be sure to not overdraft you colonial capacity, or all builds will fail.</b></p>

<p><strong>Colonial build example 1:</strong></p>
<p><i>Making a colonial build</i></p>
<p> W 1901. England gains from 13 to 15 SC.<br />
  + F London<br />
  Waive</p>
<p>W 1902. England gains to 16 SC. England can do one colonial in any owned SC and one home build for the new SC. (May of course waive the new one to build colonially 1903 or England may build both at home as well)<br />
  + F Vancouver<br />
  + F Liverpool</p>
<p><br />
<i>Not making a colonial build.</i></p>
<p>W 1901. England gains from 13 to 15 SC.<br />
  + F London<br />
  + F Liverpool</p>
<p>W 1902. England gains to 16 SC. England cannot do a colonial build as there was no waive last year.<br />
  + F London</p>
<p><br />
<i>Failing a colonial build.</i></p>
<p>W 1901. England gains from 13 to 15 SC.<br />
  + F London<br />
  Waive</p>
<p>W 1902. England fall back to 14 SC.
  No build anywhere due to lack of SCs.<br />

<p><strong>Colonial build example 2:</strong></p>
<p>Powers A, B and C all increase from 6 to 7 SC in year 1.</p>

<p><b>W 1901</b></p>

<p>A<br />
Waive</p>

<p>B <br />
Build at home</p>

<p>C<br />
Waive</p>
<br />
<p>In year 2, A stays on 7 SC, B increase to 8 SC and C decrease to 6 SC.</p>

<p><b>W 1902</b></p>

<p>A<br />
Can build at home or colonially</p>

<p>B<br />
Can only build at home</p>

<p>C<br />
Cannot build</p>

<p>So since A had waived last year she can build a colonial unit. A can also choose to build at home, but must then waive again if she wants to build colonially later. B did not waive last year and can only build at home (or waive for a build 1903). C did waive, but does not longer have the required SC to build anything.</p>
