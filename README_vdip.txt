Note to webmasters
-------------------
vDiplomacy is based on the webdiplomacy code with some small changes and I'll try to stick as close as possible to the original codebse.
If you do not need a special vDiplomacy-feature I strongly reccomend running the webdip-code instead of vDiploamcy. All variants _should_
work with the webdiploamcy code as well.


Install
-------
Follow the original webdiplomacy README.txt for a step-by-step installation guide
After importing the install.sql to your database import
 install/update_vdip.sql
to generate some additional table entries.
