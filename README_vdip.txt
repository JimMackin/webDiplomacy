Note to webmasters
-------------------
vDiplomacy is based on the webdiplomacy code with some small changes and I'll try to stick as close as possible to the original codebase.
If you do not need a special vDiplomacy-feature I strongly recommend running the webdip-code instead of vDiplomacy. All variants (but 1900)
_should_ work with the webdiplomacy code as well.


Install
-------
Follow the original webdiplomacy README.txt for a step-by-step installation guide
vDip requires quite a lot of new sql-tables and entries.
After you have installed the FullInstall.SQL for the webdip-tables load the FullInstall-vDip.SQL for the vDip-changes too.
