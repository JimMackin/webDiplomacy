            <ul>
                <li>
                Please provide a link to your game or the game name (spelled correctly!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please explain why you need a pause, how long you need it for, and the urgency. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                If reporting a cheater:

                <li>
                    Links to the accounts of the players who you suspect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Link(s) to any specific game(s) that raised your suspicions.
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
